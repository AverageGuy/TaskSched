sentence=Cooperative task scheduler for Arduino, ESP* and others.
paragraph=TaskSched is a cooperative multitasking scheduler for Arduino processors, designed as a simpler alternative to existing schedulers like TaskScheduler. It provides a flexible and efficient way to manage multiple tasks in Arduino projects without relying on delay() or complex millis() logic. The library enables clean, maintainable code by allowing tasks to voluntarily yield control when finished or waiting, making it particularly well-suited for ESP32 and ESP8266 processors while remaining compatible with other Arduino architectures.
